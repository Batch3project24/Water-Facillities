        <i><h1 id="Water facilities"><span style="color: rgb(121, 3, 72);" >Water Supply:</span></h1></i>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Water supply is the provision of water by public utilities, commercial organisations, community endeavors or by individuals, usually via a system of pumps and pipes. Public water supply systems are crucial to properly functioning societies. These systems are what supply drinking water to populations around the globe.[1] Aspects of service quality include continuity of supply, water quality and water pressure. The institutional responsibility for water supply is arranged differently in different countries and regions.</p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family:'Times New Roman';">Water supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate treatment, including groundwater (aquifers), surface water (lakes and rivers), and the sea through desalination. The water treatment steps include, in most cases, purification, disinfection through chlorination and sometimes fluoridation. Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to reservoirs, which can be elevated such as water towers or on the ground (for indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see non-revenue water). Once water is used, wastewater is typically discharged in a sewer system and treated in a sewage treatment plant before being discharged into a river, lake, or the sea or reused for landscaping or irrigation.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 136);" >Water Supply Network</span></h2>
        <P style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A water supply network or water supply system is a system of engineered hydrologic and hydraulic components that provide water supply. A water supply system typically includes the following:</P>

        <ol start="1">
        <li style="font-size: 19px;">A drainage basin (see water purification – sources of drinking water)</li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px;">A raw water collection point (above or below ground) where the water accumulates, such as a lake, a river, or groundwater from an underground aquifer. Raw water may be transferred using uncovered ground-level aqueducts, covered tunnels, or underground water pipes to water purification facilities.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px;">Water purification facilities. Treated water is transferred using water pipes (usually underground).</li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px;"> Water storage facilities such as reservoirs, water tanks, or water towers. Smaller water systems may store the water in cisterns or pressure vessels. Tall buildings may also need to store water locally in pressure vessels in order for the water to reach the upper floors.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px;">Additional water pressurizing components such as pumping stations may need to be situated at the outlet of underground or aboveground reservoirs or cisterns (if gravity flow is impractical).</li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px;">A pipe network for distribution of water to consumers (which may be private houses or industrial, commercial, or institution establishments) and other usage points (such as fire hydrants)</li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px;">Connections to the sewers (underground pipes, or aboveground ditches in some developing countries) are generally found downstream of the water consumers, but the sewer system is considered to be a separate system, rather than part of the water supply system.</li></ol>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 136);" >Water Facillities in RURAL vs URBAN Areas</span></h2>
        <h3><span style="color: rgba(161, 63, 32, 0.911)" >Water facilities in Rural Areas</span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family:'Times New Roman';">Traditionally, the people in rural areas have obtained water from unprotected ponds or
        tanks, wells, cisterns and sometimes streams and rivers. These water sources are
        frequented daily for collecting drinking and cooking water, washing clothes, bathing,
        livestock washing, etc. Mostly, these waters are unsafe for consumption due to
        contamination by fecal matters as well as by their heavy use. Consequently, the
        populations suffer from frequent epidemics. To supply potable water to all such
        communities by an ideal comprehensive water supply system that supplies water with a
        quality matching international standards, is not feasible. Water quality standards which
        have less bearing on health (such as hardness of water, or the presence of iron and
        manganese or chlorides normally included in any drinking water of quality standards)
        can possibly be relaxed unless this causes technical problems, and so long as the rural
        population finds the water acceptable.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="img">

        </div>
        <br>

        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family:'Times New Roman';">This will help to minimize financial constraints in providing safe drinking water. Considering the present situation of rural communities,
        where water from polluted sources is carried over long distances and used directly, any
        simple improvement in service and water quality could be expected to have a large
        beneficial impact on health. That is to say that what is needed is an effective short-term
        alternative to the ideal situation. To improve water facillilities in rural areas,government should take initiate by following some alternative measures.some of them are:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">To improve appropriate water sources in the villages.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">To follow an appropriate water extraction methods to collect water from the water sources.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">It is very much needed to build better Water Distribution System in the villages.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">It is important to improve low cost water treatment systems,wherever required.</li>

        <h3><span style="color: rgba(161, 63, 32, 0.911)" >Water facilities in Urban Areas</span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family:'Times New Roman';">Urban water-supply systems are increasingly burdened because of increase in population, economic growth, lifestyle changes and urbanization. Climate change puts additional pressure on the already stressed “urban water systems” by aggravating the challenges of water scarcity and water quality deterioration. Developing and underdeveloped nations are further disadvantaged because of lack of resources, rapid population growth, low GDP, polluting industries, insufficient response from institutions, and imperfect planning and management practices. This chapter introduces the area of “urban water supply,” its management, and the influence of climate change on it. It further goes on to explore the impacts of climate change on the urban water-supply systems in the context of developing and underdeveloped countries.  </p>

        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family:'Times New Roman';"> Several mitigation, adaptation, and management approaches are discussed to deal with the challenges of climate change on urban water-supply systems. The methods of adaptation and mitigation to the impacts of climate change on urban water utilities in case of developing and underdeveloped nations is geared toward the use of affordable technologies, community participation, use of available resources, and adaptable management structure.</p>

        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family:'Times New Roman';">The urban water supply systems allocate water distribution, collection and management of stormwater, and treatment and management of wastewater. These supply systems also transport potable water after treatment from a centralized water treatment plant, which is then directly supplied to end users. The major components of these systems are pipes, pumps, valves, storage containers, reservoirs, water-meters, other hardware accessories, and hydraulic apparatus (Burian et al., 2013). The key purpose of a water supply system is to deliver the necessary quantity and quality of water at an appropriate pressure without any malfunction. Numerous things cause degradation during supply, including the following points</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">the way water is treated or not, prior to its distribution.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">both the chemical and microbiological reactions that can occur during the period of supply</li>
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">reactions that occur between the water and the constituent materials of the supply system.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 19px;">
                infection from other sources which arises due to breakages in main pipelines and leakages which inappropriately retained various services to store water.</li>

        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Rapidly increasing economic and population growth in urban areas has generated corresponding increases in demand for augmentation of water supplies. Irrigation, by far the largest water use, remains a mainstay of some local and state economies. Perhaps the most rapidly escalating call for water is motivated by concern for environmental and recreational values, values not protected by law or public advocacy in the early evolution of western water allocation. These increasing and shifting patterns of demand are being exerted on a resource already fully appropriated in most of the region.</p>
