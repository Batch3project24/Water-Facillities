        <p style="font-size:20px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Water Resources are sources of water that are useful or potentially useful to humans.
            Uses of water include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental
            activities. Virtually all of these human uses require fresh water. 
             </p>
             <p style="font-size:20px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            Water is a vital resource
                for human and other animal and plant health. Water bodies provide habitats for aquatic
                life and riparian systems provide moisture for vegetation and terrestrial biota,
                transporting nutrients between one ecosystem and another. As well, large
                water systems provide regional and climatic weather services. Large-scale withdrawals or
                transfers of water can change ecological conditions</p>

        <i><h1 id="Utilisation"><span style="color: rgb(5, 119, 30);" >Utilisation:</span></h1></i>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Usage of fresh water can be categorized as consumptive and non-consumptive (sometimes
            called "renewable"). A use of water is consumptive if that water is not immediately
            available for another use. Losses to sub-surface seepage and evaporation are considered
            consumptive, as is water incorporated into a product (such as farm produce). Water that
            can be treated and returned as surface water, such as sewage, is generally considered nonconsumptive if that water can be put to additional use. Water resources are used in
            various ways including direct consumption, agricultural irrigation, fisheries, hydropower,
            industrial production, recreation, navigation, environmental protection, the disposal and
            treatment of sewage, and industrial effluents</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">Water consumption can be mainly categorized into three types.They are:</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">1.Agricultural purposes</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">2.Industrial purposes</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">3.Domestic purposes</p>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(192, 33, 55);" >1.Agricultural Purposes</span></h2>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">It is estimated that 69% of worldwide water use is for irrigation, with 15-35% of
            irrigation withdrawals being unsustainable. Various irrigation
            methods involve different trade-offs between crop yield, water consumption and capital
            cost of equipment and structures. Irrigation methods such as furrow and overhead
            sprinkler irrigation are usually less expensive but are also typically less efficient, because
            much of the water evaporates, runs off or drains below the root zone. </p>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(192, 33, 55);" >2.Industrial Purposes</span></h2>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water use is industrial. Major industrial users
            include power plants, which use water for cooling or as a power source (i.e. hydroelectric
            plants), ore and oil refineries, which use water in chemical processes, and manufacturing
            plants, which use water as a solvent. The portion of industrial water usage that is
            consumptive varies widely, but as a whole is lower than agricultural use.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(192, 33, 55);" >3.Domestic Purposes</span></h2>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;">It is estimated that 8% of worldwide water use is for household purposes. These include
            drinking water, bathing, cooking, sanitation, and gardening. Basic household water
            requirements have been estimated by Peter Gleick at around 50 liters per person per day,
            excluding water for gardens. Drinking water is water that is of sufficiently high quality so
            that it can be consumed or used without risk of immediate or long term harm. Such water
            is commonly called potable water</p>

    <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Despite formidable constraints, some attempts to describe global water use have lead to
        amenable conclusions. For example, estimates indicate that since 1900, global water
        withdrawal has increased about nine-fold and per capita withdrawal has quadrupled.
        Globally, the largest use of water is for irrigation (70 percent), while industry uses 20
        percent, and the remaining 10 percent is utilized for direct human consumption. As a
        result, humans now withdraw about 35 percent of the worldâ€™s reliable runoff.</p>
