        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Drinking water or potable water is water that is safe for ingestion, either when drunk directly in liquid form or consumed indirectly through food preparation. It is often (but not always) supplied through taps, in which case it is also called tap water. Typically in developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation.</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental conditions.For those who work in a hot climate, up to 16 litres (4.2 US gal) a day may be required.Globally, by 2015, 89% of people had access to water from a source that is suitable for drinking â€“ called improved water sources.</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Nearly 4.2 billion people worldwide had access to tap water, while another 2.4 billion had access to wells or public taps. The World Health Organization considers access to safe drinking-water a basic human right.About 1 to 2 billion people lack safe drinking water.</p>

        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The recommended daily amount of drinking water for humans varies.It depends on activity, age, health, and environment. In the United States, the Adequate Intake for total water, based on median intakes, is 4.0 litres per day for males older than 18, and 3.0 litres per day for females over 18; it assumes about 80% from drink and 20% from food.The European Food Safety Authority recommends 2.0 litres of total water per day for women and 2.5 litres per day for men.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(121, 3, 72);" >Quality of Drinking water</span></h2>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">According to the World Health Organization's 2017 report, safe drinking water is water that "does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including different sensitivities that may occur between life stages".

            According to a report by UNICEF and UNESCO, Finland has the best drinking water quality in the world.</p>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Drinking water quality standards describes the quality parameters set for drinking water. Water may contain many harmful constituents, yet there are no universally recognized and accepted international standards for drinking water. Even where standards do exist, the permitted concentration of individual constituents may vary by as much as ten times from one set of standards to another.</p>
        <div class="img">
            <center><img src="e3.jpg"></center>
        </div>   
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Drinking water standards include lists of parametric values, and also specify the sampling location, sampling methods, sampling frequency, analytical methods, and laboratory accreditation (AQC). In addition, a number of standards documents also require calculation to determine whether a level exceeds the standard, such as taking an average. Some standards give complex, detailed requirements for the statistical treatment of results, temporal and seasonal variations, summation of related parameters, and mathematical treatment of apparently aberrant results.</p>
        <h2><span style="color: rgb(121, 3, 72);" >Health Issues Due To Quality of Drinking water</span></h2>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Low Quality Water can be called as Contaminated water. Contaminated Water is estimated to result in more than half a million deaths per year. Contaminated water together with the lack of sanitation was estimated to cause about one percent of disability adjusted life years worldwide in 2010. According to the WHO, the most common diseases linked with poor water quality are cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio.</p>
        <div class="img">

        </div>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">One of the main causes for contaminated drinking water in developing countries is lack of sanitation and poor hygiene. For this reason, the quantification of the burden of disease from consuming contaminated drinking water usually looks at water, sanitation and hygiene aspects together. The acronym for this is WASH - standing for water, sanitation and hygiene.The WHO has investigated which proportion of death and disease worldwide can be attributed to insufficient WASH services. In their analysis they focus on the following four health outcomes: diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, undernutrition</p>

        <h2><span style="color: rgb(121, 3, 72);" >Safety Measures to avoid Drinking Contaminated Water</span></h2>
        <h3><span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 136)" >1. Boil water for drinking:</span></h3>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Boiling removes the temporary hardness by expelling carbon-di -oxide and precipitating
            the insoluble calcium carbonate. It kills all bacterias pores, cyst and ova. The water
            must be brought to a " rolling boil" for 5-10 mins.</p>

        <h3><span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 136);" >2. Water should be chlorinated to kill germs</span></h3>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Chlorination is one of the greatest advances in water purification. Chlorine kills
            Pathogenic bacteria, it oxidises iron manganese and hydrogen sulphide. It controls
            algae and slime organisms and aids coagulation.</p>

        <h3><span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 136);" >3. After boiling filter the water so that sediments in water are separated</span></h3>
        <p style="font-size:19px ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Filter candles remove bacteria found in water. It also helps in separation of sediments
            from water.</p>
